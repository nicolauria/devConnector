functional and class components
anything that we need access to is in this.props
we pass in props from our component and in mSTP, mDTP
we then deconstruct those props

when creating a private route (private.js) the component will not
successfully render unless you include withRouter on the wrapped component
- i believe this may have something to do with webpack
- putting a switch around the component also fixed the bug

because dom updates occur asynchronously and in batches you should pass a
function into this.setState when attempting to access the prevState
this.setState(prevState => ({
  displaySocialInputs: !prevState.displaySocialInputs
}));

the less moving on the screen the easier it is on the eyes
for example scrolling a form

one of the props of our PrivateRoute is auth so when we delete an account
and reset our auth state the PrivateRoute rerenders and redirects to login

React elements are just plain objects. React DOM handles turning these objects
into actual HTML elements

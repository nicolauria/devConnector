implement auth routes so logged in user cannot access /login or /register

clearCurrentUser used in Navbar.js and App.js
- conside just putting action into logoutUser() function

functional and class components
anything that we need access to is in this.props
we pass in props from our component and in mSTP, mDTP
we then deconstruct those props

when creating a private route (private.js) the component will not
successfully render unless you include withRouter on the wrapped component
- i believe this may have something to do with webpack
- putting a switch around the component also fixed the bug
